          Hello, I'm Tadas Tamošauskas.
          </br>
          <strong>Open to contract work or co-founding a business.</strong>

          <i>
            I've been solving business problems using my programming skills since 2010.
            I believe that strong technical skills is just
            a bare minimum for a great developer.
            The best developers are those who understand the business model and
            the root cause of the problem they are solving.

          <h2>What I can do</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Programming</strong>: I am the most confident with Ruby and JavaScript, but I'm happy to step out of my comfort zone. I can also design and build APIs. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/esmekzd3s3mw1xr/Tadas_Tamo_CV.pdf?dl=0">See my CV</a> for a more detailed list of my skills and past experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Building and leading a dev team</strong>: I have interviewed, hired and mentored developers for many teams. I can help you set-up your recruitment and onboarding pipeline, then train a replacement for myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Workshops</strong>: I have done workshops introducing Ruby on Rails to teams considering adopting this framework.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Advisory work</strong>: I also do long-term relationshipts with startups where they can tap into my skill-set on an ad-hoc basis, think of it as a fractional lead-engineer as a service.
          </p>
        </p>

        <p>
         <h2>What sets me apart</h2>

         <p>
           <strong>I care</strong>: as a contractor, I care about my reputation. I know I have a limited time on each project and therefore I do my absolute best at it.
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>I see the big picture</strong>: seeing things from a technical angle is not enough. I always study the domain, then take a step back and consider the end user needs before making important decisions.
         </p>
        </p>

        <p>
         <h2>What others have to say</h2>
        <strong>Chris P. <i>CTO at Lollipop</i></strong>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Tadas is an extremely versatile and effective senior engineer - you can introduce him to a problem, and he'll digest it and coordinate with the rest of the team to get it sorted fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            He's got a great entrepreneurial attitude: he'll give useful insights and raise important questions across the whole business given a chance. Can't recommend hiring him enough.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

         <strong>Rob B. <i>Team Lead at Trainline</i></strong>

         <blockquote>
           <p>
            Tadas has made a huge impact in the year that he's worked at trainline. He has the rare combination of awesome technical skills and the ability communicate supremely with his peers.
           </p>

           <p>
             During his time here he's consistently delivered way above expectations. His Ruby skills are excellent, but even more impressive is his ability to foster close collaboration and his drive to make the project succeed. He has improved communication and process across teams in our London office and built strong ties with teams co-located internationally.
           </p>

           <p>
             I hope to work with Tadas again in the near future and would offer him a permanent position on the team without hesitation.
           </p>

         <strong>Tom S. <i>Product Manager at Government Digital Service</i></strong>

         <blockquote>
           <p>
             Tadas is an excellent developer, he understands complex environments and finds creative solutions to difficult problems. Tadas is great at taking user needs and creating clear success criteria leading to useful features for the products he works on. Tadas is really reliable and insightful, he always delivers on time.

          <h2>What I would like to work on</h2>
